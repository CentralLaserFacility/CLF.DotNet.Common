Rotation and Mirroring

  Distinct operations, chained together ?

  Cleaner but more expensive ; computation and memory
  
  ?? What are the options we need to support ??

Profile

  Display same pixels as the 'resized' image 

  Or display the entire full-resolution data
    - Glitches with high-intensity-valued pixels will show up,
      but low-valued glitches won't !
  
Options for resizing with alternatives to nearest-neighbour ?

  Identify a patch of pixels ...
    - take 'centre' value
    - max in that patch
    - min in that patch
    - average over that patch

Zoom and pan !!

======================

Need to be clear as to when we're mutating an image,
vs when we're creating a mutated clone of the image.

Nice to think of images as immutable, with operations
applied in a chain ... but there are efficiency concerns ?

Naming convention ?
  cloned  = original.CreateClone_Resized() ;
  mutated = original.PerformResize() ;

==================

Graphics primitives ?

Sharing code with the WinUI Viewer !!!

FluentAssertions ??
